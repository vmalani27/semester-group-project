EC-Council’s Certified Ethical Hacker training (ECC-CEH) certifies a security professional as an Ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester. CEH training certifies an ethical hacker's abilities to guard against the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of network infrastructure and illegal hacking. A CEH certification is helpful considering the increasing security threats to computer networks and web servers and the need to make networks ""hacker-proof"". The best way to do this is to understand the methods employed by hackers to intrude into systems.    The Certified Ethical Hacker program is the pinnacle of the most desired information security training program any information security professional will ever want to be in. To master hacking technologies, you will need to become one, but an ethical one! The accredited course provides advanced hacking tools and techniques hackers, and information security professionals use to break into an organization. As we put it, *“To beat a hacker, you need to think like a hacker”*. This course will immerse you into the Hacker Mindset so that you will be able to defend against future attacks. The security mindset in any organization must not be limited to the silos of a specific vendor, technologies, or pieces of equipment.    This ethical hacking training will introduce the students to an interactive environment where they will be shown how to scan, test, hack, and secure their systems. The lab-intensive environment gives each student in-depth knowledge and practical experience with the current essential security systems. Students will begin by understanding how perimeter defenses work and then learn how to scan and hack their networks (no real network is harmed) to spot vulnerabilities.

EC-Council’s Certified Ethical Hacker training (ECC-CEH) certifies a security professional as an Ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester. CEH training certifies an ethical hacker's abilities to guard against the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of network infrastructure and illegal hacking. A CEH certification is helpful considering the increasing security threats to computer networks and web servers and the need to make networks ""hacker-proof"". The best way to do this is to understand the methods employed by hackers to intrude into systems. The Certified Ethical Hacker program is the pinnacle of the most desired information security training program any information security professional will ever want to be in. To master hacking technologies, you will need to become one, but an ethical one! The accredited course provides advanced hacking tools and techniques hackers, and information security professionals use to break into an organization. As we put it, “To beat a hacker , you need to think like a hacker ” . This course will immerse you into the Hacker Mindset so that you will be able to defend against future attacks. The security mindset in any organization must not be limited to the silos of a specific vendor, technologies, or pieces of equipment. This ethical hacking training will introduce the students to an interactive environment where they will be shown how to scan, test, hack, and secure their systems. The lab-intensive environment gives each student in-depth knowledge and practical experience with the current essential security systems. Students will begin by understanding how perimeter defenses work and then learn how to scan and hack their networks (no real network is harmed) to spot vulnerabilities. During this ethical hacking course, students learn how intruders escalate privileges and what steps can be taken to secure a system.

Here in the given linux executable, you have to brute force the inputs by creating a local bash script that would input numbers one by one and output the correct number that is being accepted. Check the attached script to understand the logic.   These are all the intended solutions. There are other unintended ways as well that we hadn't taken into consideration.

AICTE in collaboration with YOL are celebrating the world happiness day on the *20th March 24 at 10.30 am *onwards (program attached).  This is further to the AICTE’s last notification announcing the Institutional happiness ranking as per which institutions were requested to register on www.yol.one who are also requested to track and forward a compliance status of registration of each institution. This assumes significance since this report will be sent to UN SDSN. The world happiness report is created by UN SDSN where India is rated on the 126th position out of 145 countries in the world.  Social and emotional learning has also been included in the Approval Process Handbook 2024-2027, aligning with NEP's emphasis on these. The YOL program facilitates students to practice and sharpen their social and emotional skills.

Here are the solutions for all the challenges as promised :) I have zipped and attached all the necessary files for you to reproduce the challenges locally. These are all the intended solutions. There are other unintended ways as well that we hadn't taken into consideration. Well done if you managed to solve a challenge with a new way that is not mentioned here. Reach out to Het Soni (21cs068@charusat.edu.in, +91 95109 56552) for any queries regarding the CTF.   ** Welcome* Solution: You had to visit the /robots.txt file on the same domain where the CTF was hosted.   * *I can't SEEEEE IT* Solution: From the source code of the page you can see it is fetching the flag from a remote API. Check the Network activity with inspect when you click the get flag button.   * *Secure Login* Solution: You can edit frontend html from inspect. Remove 'disabled' from all html form elements to enter text into the fields. Entering default credentials 'admin:password' and pressing the login button fetched the flag but didn't display on the front end. You again had to see the network activity and check the response from the remote API.   * *Encoding is not encryption!* Challenge: VEhNe0NyeXB0MEJAYnl9 Solution: Base64 encoded string.   * *Stupid Chemistry* Challenge: 39 EA 1 6 2 M 53 16 TR 39 Solution: Periodic Table cipher - dcode.fr/atomic-number-substitution   ** QR Busted!* Solution: QR codes are in a pattern. Fill in the missing two corners by copying the top right corner and scan it for the solution.   ** Find me if you can* Challenge: ""Co-lead of The Hackers Meetup, Harshiv Kinariwala doesn't follow security policies and posts company secrets on social media! Can you believe that! Find that secret to get the flag."" Solution: twitter.com/h_kinariwala   * *The Third Eye* Solution: A mp3 file is given. Use tools like audacity or skel to visualize it.

Hello Hackers! Here are the solutions for all the challenges as promised :) I have zipped and attached all the necessary files for you to reproduce the challenges locally. These  are all the intended solutions. There are other unintended ways as well  that we hadn't taken into consideration. Well done if you managed to  solve a challenge with a new way that is not mentioned here. Reach out to Het Soni ( 21cs068@charusat.edu.in , +91 95109 56552) for any queries regarding the CTF. * Welcome Solution: You had to visit the /robots.txt file on the same domain where the CTF was hosted. * I can't SEEEEE IT Solution: From the source code of the page you can see it is fetching the flag from a remote API. Check the Network activity with inspect when you click the get flag button. * Secure Login Solution: You  can edit frontend html from inspect. Remove 'disabled' from all html  form elements to enter text into the fields. Entering default  credentials 'admin:password' and pressing the login button fetched the  flag but didn't display on the front end. You again had to see the  network activity and check the response from the remote API. * Encoding is not encryption! Challenge: VEhNe0NyeXB0MEJAYnl9 Solution: Base64 encoded string. * Stupid Chemistry Challenge: 39 EA 1 6 2 M 53 16 TR 39 Solution: Periodic Table cipher - dcode.fr/atomic-number-substitution * QR Busted! Solution: QR codes are in a pattern. Fill in the missing two corners by copying the top right corner and scan it for the solution. * Find me if you can Challenge:  ""Co-lead of The Hackers Meetup, Harshiv Kinariwala doesn't follow  security policies and posts company secrets on social media! Can you believe that! Find that secret to get the flag."" Solution: twitter.com/h_kinariwala * The Third Eye Solution: A mp3 file is given. Use tools like audacity or skel to visualize it. It was Spectrogram Stegnography. Many have submitted the flag correctly but you were supposed to replace whitespaces with an underscore ( _ ). * RUN ME Solution: The problem category was pwn where you are given an executable and you have to understand it's nature and logic and exploit it.
